## Farbod Ahmadian 👋

Hey! I'm Farbod. I'm a software engineer interested in
data storage, distributed systems and data processing systems.

Recently

- Finished ["Build your own Redis by Codecrafters"](https://github.com/farbodahm/codecrafters-redis-go)
- Finished ["Build your own BitTorrent by Codecrafters"](https://github.com/farbodahm/codecrafters-bittorrent-go)
- and some other stuff you can find on my Github.
