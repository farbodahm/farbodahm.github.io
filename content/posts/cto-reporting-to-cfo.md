Recently, I was talking to a colleague and friend about a pattern we've noticed;
in most **Tech-Aided** companies we've seen, the `CTO reports to the CFO` ([Chief Financial Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer)).

There are two types of companies:

1. Companies that generate revenue directly from a tech product (like Uber, Twitch, etc.); these are *Tech-First*.  
2. Companies that already have a non-tech product and adopt technology to support or improve it; these are *Tech-Aided*.

### Why is it that, in most Tech-Aided companies I've seen, the CTO reports to the CFO?

I think the reason is that these companies often see technology as a cost center, a "money pit".  
So the CFO needs to keep things under budget and tightly controlled.

### Is that a bad thing?

Not necessarily.  
You just need to evaluate whether you're a good fit for that kind of environment.

### Some of the challenges I've noticed in these companies include:

- They often donâ€™t have a clear vision for what they want from tech.  
- They may not know how to manage technical teams effectively.  
- Communication tends to be top-down, like a war room, rather than collaborative.

### Does it mean Tech-First companies are doing any better?

Again, not necessarily. I've seen plenty of Tech-First companies that struggle with
the same issues, in different domains and industries.

I simply wanted to share a pattern I've observed.
If you know of a company that doesn't follow this pattern, I'd love to hear more about it over a coffee chat :)
